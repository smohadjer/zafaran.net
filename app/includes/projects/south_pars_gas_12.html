	<p>The Phase 12 Gas field is south eastern block of South Pars Gas Field, on border line with Qatar, in an area measuring 206 square kilometers. The offshore section is approximately 150 km from Iranâ€™s coastline and the onshore section is located in the Tombak Region (65km west of Assaluyeh). The main objective of this project is to produce and transport 3 billion cubic feet of gas/day from four wellhead platforms in which 45 wells are drilled in. The treated and sweetened gas in onshore facilities is then transported to IGAT VI nationwide pipeline. Condensates are then exported via sealines and SBMs. Final products of this mega project are 78 MMcmd per day natural gas for transportation by the sixth Iranian Gas Trunk Line (IGAT6), 110.000 barrels per day heavy condensates and production of 760 tonnes per day granulated sulphur.</p>
